Data Exploration
The features in the data fall into three major types, namely financial features, email features and POI labels.
There are 146 samples with 20 features and a binary classification ("poi"), 2774 data points.
Among 146 samples, there are 18 POI and 128 non-POI.
Among 2774, there are 1358 (48.96%) data points with NaN values.

We created a network based on the senders and receivers in the Enron email dataset, whereas, the weight of the
edge between two individuals is the sum of the number of emails between them.
First, we use visualization techniques to analyze the graph. Second we use statistics, where we use the generated
 graph of visualization. With each technique, we try to use information gathered by previously. Main findings
  We used the techniques ranking and partitioning, which are visualization techniques. We found three possible
  fraudulent individuals (one is debatable) out of five individuals for the ranking technique. For the indication,
  whether, someone is possible fraudulent we used a web search. Furthermore, the two individuals who had a much higher
  ranking value than the others, were both indicated as possible fraudulent. However, for the technique partitioning,
  the three individuals that were selected were not possible fraudulent.
We generated the egocentric networks of the nodes with the highest ranking values and looked at their overlap.
We found one individual with a strong connection to both, after a web search we indicated her as possible fraudulent.
 Furthermore, we looked at hubs and authorities using statistics, of the nine individuals we found, we indicated four
  as possible fraudulent. Therefore, we conclude that it is possible to perform outlier detection on a network using
  graph mining to indicate possible fraudulent individuals in a communication network


Because we had only limited time (one month) to perform this research, our research has some limitations.
We selected the scope only to look at the network itself and not at the content of the emails. Therefore, we disregarded a substantial amount of information.

Furthermore, this paper is focussed on researching outlier detection using graph mining specifically on the Enron email dataset.
Therefore, we can only give an indication of the quality and effectiveness of the graph mining techniques on outlier detection.
At last, we have done a web search to indicate if individuals are fraudulent concerning Enron. However, these indications do not have to be true.

Furthermore, we found too little information for some of the individuals to make an indication.
